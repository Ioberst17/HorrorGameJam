//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Crusher Enemy asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders corresponding to each color style.

- In any of the style folders, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains inividual animation frames as PNG files. The animations are split up into their own folders.

- In the style folders, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains two spritesheets:

	- A descriptive, fully-labeled spritesheet (For beginners)
	- A compact, unlabeled spritesheet with minimal spacing (For advanced users)

Each spritesheet comes with a parseable metadata file for reading the spritesheet.

- All animations are 10 FPS, but you can speed them up if you'd like.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!

-Will
